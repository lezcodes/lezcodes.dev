# Welcome to the Monospace Web

This is the first post on this monospace-themed blog! This site is built with **Next.js**, **MDX**, and styled with **Geist Mono** font throughout.

## What makes this special?

Unlike most websites that use proportional fonts, this entire site uses monospace fonts exclusively. This creates a unique aesthetic that's both nostalgic and modern.

### Features

- **MDX Support**: Write blog posts with embedded React components
- **Math Rendering**: LaTeX math expressions via KaTeX
- **Code Highlighting**: Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- **Monospace Everything**: Consistent character spacing throughout

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component:

```tsx
interface Props {
  title: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

export function Card({ title, children }: Props) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Math Example

The quadratic formula is:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

And here's an inline equation: $E = mc^2$

## Typography

The monospace constraint creates interesting design challenges and opportunities:

1. **Alignment**: Everything naturally aligns in columns
2. **Rhythm**: Consistent character spacing creates visual rhythm  
3. **Focus**: The constraint forces focus on content over decoration
4. **Nostalgia**: Reminds us of early computing and terminals

This approach to web design prioritizes readability and consistency over flashy visuals, creating a unique and focused reading experience.
