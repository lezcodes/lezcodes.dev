excerpt: "my favorite resouces on data structures, algorithms, system design and more"

i will dump anything cool related to software here. i will try to categorize them, so in case i fail categorizing them in the future, just prompt against the page and ask any ai.

> **pro tip:** pick whatever works for you, do not get too attached to a technology. you're a problem solver, not a typescript or python writer. never stop learning.
