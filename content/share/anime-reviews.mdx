# anime reviews

quick reviews and recommendations for anime series i've enjoyed.

## currently watching

**frieren: beyond journey's end** - a contemplative fantasy series about time, memory, and what it means to truly understand others.

## all-time favorites

**cowboy bebop** - the perfect blend of jazz, space westerns, and existential philosophy. the soundtrack alone makes it worth watching.

**steins;gate** - time travel done right with compelling characters and emotional depth.

**monster** - a psychological thriller that explores morality and the nature of evil.

## recent watches

**mob psycho 100** - character growth wrapped in spectacular animation.

**vinland saga** - vikings, revenge, and redemption. season 2 especially hits different.
